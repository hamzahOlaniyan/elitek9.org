      "If you wanted to have us train your own dog before accepting it in for training we first conduct a k9 assessment of your dog and maintain an honest and realistic policy about what we can achieve with your dog and deliver every time. Some dogs have the capabilities for protection work and some don't, but either way, we will tell you from the offset after the assessment.",

      "Through our K9 family matching process, the dogs welfare is always a key concern. We will only part ways with a dog, if we are sure the dog will be in good care and a lasting relationship with the client is guaranteed, and an after-care regime follows every purchase. This is to ensure the happiness of both the dog and the client.",

      "We do not view training protection and security dogs as a sport, and would never place a sporting dog in a family home as these dogs are not trained and conditioned to take on real situations when a person's life maybe in danger. This is bad practice, and morally wrong.",
