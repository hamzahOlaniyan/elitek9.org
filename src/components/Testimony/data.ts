      "We were referred to Elite K9 for dog training for our 2 German Shepherd puppies. From the outset the service delivered was professional, friendly, informative and supportive. The owner, Ibrahim, answered every question in detail and was in regular contact with us via WhatsApp or the phone. From the outset we saw a marked improvement in the puppies behaviour, they were calmer and able to follow basic commands and this continued and was improved upon throughout the duration of the course. We are very pleased with the results, especially since Ibrahim, has also offered any ongoing support; should we need it. Thank you very much Ibrahim, Hamza and the rest of the team.",

      "My dog Rod was bought for protection of my home but little did i know that Rod required a lot of training to improve his interactions with me and people around me. EliteK9 came to visit Rod and demonstrated to me that in real life scenarios Rod will not confront intruders of my property. After 10 weeks of training with EliteK9, Rod is now a level 2 protection dog and i am very impressed with the new Rod, his obedience is top notch and i was always updated on the status of Rod via videos and multiple phone calls. Ibrahim is also very patient and takes time to explain certain issues in detail to help me understand my dog better. I am absolutely happy with the level of training Rod received and will be sending him in for more training. I highly recommend the services of Elite K9",

      "I was introduced to Ebrahim a few weeks after having had one of most traumatizing experiences in my home. I was held hostage by 5 armed men along with  my 9-year-old daughter and her friend. I had all forms of security measures installed (high walls,barbed wires, cameras, alarm system, security personnel) but this still managed to happen. Looking back to identify what I could have done differently to protect my home and family, and what could have given us more time react accordingly, I concluded that I needed guard/protection dogs. I am happy to say that I found what I was looking for and more in Tank, who was provided by Ebrahim. Tank is well trained to protect yet is very compatible with my lifestyle,needing less attention than I had presumed, follows orders diligently, excuses himself like a gentleman and most importantly loves his family and shows us daily. A teddy bear and monster all in one, we sleep soundly knowing we are protected with the discipline and skill sets instilled in Tank. Above all that it will be done with love. Thank you for your continued service and making our lives a lot safer.The passion that you have for your dogs and what you do stews.Lots of love & Gratitude J",

He’s diligent, thorough and is an expert at dog training. Our dog Chief, is excellent at guarding our property. There have been ZERO break ins since having a dog and we sleep peacefully at night, knowing we have a dog on guard 24/7. We’d highly recommend Ebrahim to anyone looking for a professional dog trainer.",

Then i met Ibrahim, a calm young gentleman with so much respect and integrity. He has transformed Zena to a well trained guard dog that I am so proud of. I never had a beware of the dog sign on my gate but after the few weeks of Zena’s training with Ibrahim, I had to put a sign outside proudly. Thank you for everything, my family and I are grateful.",
